      <h2>ME</h2>
      <p class="wrap-text">
        As a dynamic problem solver and creative mind, I possess a unique blend of insight and technical acumen. 
        With a deep appreciation for designing new technologies and a knack for understanding intricate systems, 
        I thrive on creating innovative solutions from scratch. My love for automation and robotics stems from a 
        desire to streamline processes and eliminate repetitive tasks. My goal is to contribute to society by 
        developing systems that address real-world challenges. I bring a hands-on approach, coupled with a passion 
        for creating impactful solutions that make a difference.

    <h2>SKILLS</h2>
    <p>
      Skills can be likened to ammunition in a war; without them, there would be no ability to engage in battle when the need arises. 
      Just as we constantly update our ammunition, it is essential to continually update our skills to remain effective and prepared for any challenges that may arise.
